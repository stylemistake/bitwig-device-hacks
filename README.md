# Bitwig Device Hacks

If you're feeling that Bitwig modulation system is not complete, you're not
alone. With this tool you will be able to modify the Math device and create
your own.

Bitwig Studio 2.0 has a DSP language, called "Nitro", which Bitwig developers
use to power their modulation system and their new Amp device. Source code of
these devices is stored in plain text, and compiled at runtime.

This language doesn't have an open API yet, but who needs API when it's
quite easy to hack yourself in?

## DISCLAIMER

We do not take any responsibility and we are not liable for any damage caused
through use of this code. Devices which you build using this tool are not
guaranteed to work after a major update of Bitwig Studio and can break at any
moment. Custom devices are currently disallowed in Bitwig Studio as it uses
a device whitelist, so you will not be able to save your projects with custom
devices.
